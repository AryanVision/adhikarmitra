# Specification Quality Checklist: Comprehensive AP Government Departments Data

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: November 8, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Pass**: All checklist items completed successfully.

**Key Strengths**:

- Comprehensive coverage of all AP state government departments with specific examples
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P3) with independent test criteria
- Well-defined functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-015) covering data content, presentation, search, and usability
- Measurable success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) that are technology-agnostic
- Thorough edge case analysis addressing real-world scenarios
- Clear assumptions about data sources, accuracy, scope, and maintenance
- Explicit out-of-scope boundaries to prevent scope creep

**Ready for Next Phase**: Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.
